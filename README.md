# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

This project is part of Udacity FEND Certification Course

#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, the goals are to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, I have to take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the app users.

### Specification

I use the [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues. 

### How Do I run this project?
* First, you can **download** this repo to your computer or just write in a terminal git clone 
* The simple way to run the application is with Python. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` (or some other port, if port 8080 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python -m http.server 8080`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
